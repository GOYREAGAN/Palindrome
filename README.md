# Palindrome Checker

## Project Description
The **Palindrome Checker** is a simple web-based application that allows users to check whether a given text is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case sensitivity.

## Features
- Input validation to ensure users provide a value.
- Supports alphanumeric palindromes and ignores non-alphanumeric characters.
- Provides clear and detailed feedback for various inputs.
- Clean and intuitive user interface.

## Project Structure
The project is split into three main files:
1. **HTML** (`index.html`) - Provides the structure of the webpage.
2. **CSS** (`styles.css`) - Adds styling for a clean and user-friendly interface.
3. **JavaScript** (`script.js`) - Implements the palindrome-checking logic.

## Instructions
To use the Palindrome Checker:
1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Enter text into the input box and click the "Check" button.
4. See the result displayed below the button.

## Example Outputs
Here are some examples of how the application responds:
- `A` → *A is a palindrome.*
- `eye` → *eye is a palindrome.*
- `not a palindrome` → *not a palindrome is not a palindrome.*
- `A man, a plan, a canal. Panama` → *A man, a plan, a canal. Panama is a palindrome.*

## How It Works
- The input text is cleaned by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting it to lowercase.
- The cleaned text is checked to see if it reads the same backward as forward.
- The result is displayed dynamically based on the input.

## Technology Stack
- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for styling
- **JavaScript** for logic

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for detecting palindromes in multiple languages.
- Implement mobile responsiveness for better usability on smaller screens.
- Improve error handling and user experience.
